        <p>Hello and welcome to my personal site and online Portfolio! A little bit about me, I am a college
            senior
            finishing up my last
            semester at
            Salisbury University, I am receiving my Bachelor’s degree in Communications Media Production with a
            minor in Computer
            Science. I have quite the passion for everything Computer Science, networking, IT, programming, and
            everything in between!
            The last few years I have been teaching myself all that I can in my free time and in University Classes.
            It all
            started the summer after my freshman year, when I got an itch for game development after being
            inspired
            by Nintendo’s
            Earthbound game series. After this, I knew I wanted to learn more about tech, and this is what
            started
            my journey into
            this wonderful and ever evolving field and I haven’t stopped pursuing tech since. Immediately
            following
            my graduation in
            May 2022, I will be starting my Master’s program in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at
            Western
            Governor’s
            University. My goal is to land a position as some sort of Software Developer after finishing graduate
            school.

    </h1>
    <div class="body-text">
        <p>Over the past few years, I have accomplished quite a lot , and learned many different technologies.
            This is how I did it, through a combination of self-teaching, personal projects, YouTube / online
            tutorials, university
            classes,
            internships and quite a bit of elbow grease. Here is my story from when I started to where I am now.

        <p>I am graduating from Salisbury University with a Major in Communications Media Production. In
            this track, I took
            multiple classes focusing on web development with Html, Css, and JavaScript. Additionally, I
            took a
            minor in Computer Science,
            the Computer Science track at SU is very software development based, which taught me a
            lot of essential skills
            that are standard in the industry. I took classes learning Java, C++, advanced C++ with
            algorithms and
            data
            structures, computer
            hardware, as well classes in calculus and discrete mathematics. I finished my minor in CS my
            junior
            year and all of my code,
            projects, and homework’s that I have completed are available to view on my GitHub as well as my
            code from the Web
            development classes (once I complete them).

            Information Assurance at Western Governor’s University. The program will focus on secure network
            design,
            system
            administration, IT management, ethical hacking, and secure software development. I decided to pursue
            this
            degree because
            I think it will compliment a lot of the skills I already have very well (Linux, OS, servers,
            networking,
            system
            administration, programming, database, web development) as well as make me more marketable on the

        <p>With my knowledge I had gained making games over the past year and through online videos and
            tutorials I
            watched, I was hopeful to find a summer job in between my sophmore and junior year doing something
            tech
            related. Luckily, I was able to join a
            small startup that manufactures conveyer belt control systems in Havre de Grace Maryland, that gave
            me a
            chance to prove myself in the field. I started out as a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)
            technician
            and
            programmer, in which I worked with Rockwell Automation programming and testing software. When I
            first
            joined
            the team my boss and company founder, was the only software developer at the time. He decided to
            shift
            my
            duties to also include python and MYSQL scripting to support the ever-increasing amount of clients
            we
            had
            with WCS (Warehouse Control System) related projects. I learned a lot and coded multiple projects
            for
            clients that included python, MySQL database, as well as some Linux projects involving configuration
            of
            raspberry Pis for automation. Other responsibilities included remote management of windows servers,
            continued microcontroller testing as well as some PowerShell configuration. I continued this
            internship
            through the whole summer and even returned and continued interning with them in the winter. Over the
            course
            of my internship, we did projects for Amazon, Pampered Chef, Eby Brown, and Bd Sparks. I made many
            great
            connections at pendant and was sad to part ways with the team. This startup had grown dramatically
            from
            when
            I had joined until when I left, and I hope that the company continues to grow and be successful for
            many
            years to come! Additionally, I was later able to receive credit for this as an internship at my
            university. (This Internship Presentation can be viewed <a

            Additionally , here is a link to their company site, if you have any industrial control system
            needs,
            these
            are the guys to
            do it.

        <p>During the summer in between my Junior and Senior Year, I was able to
            land a
            great opportunity at John Hopkins Carey business school in Harbor East, Baltimore city. I took
            on
            the
            role
            of a
            technical support analyst, in which I was responsible for assisting our students and staff /
            faculty, as
            well as help
            with system administration of their fleet of computers. My duties included management of Active
            Directory,
            Microsoft
            Endpoint Configuration Management console, setting up classrooms and conference rooms with
            hybrid

            remote
            on-site

            well
            as
            assisting
            those present on campus. By the end of the Summer, I had learned quite a bit about system
            administration,
            troubleshooting, OS issues, as well as working in a bigger more corporate style workplace. I
            made a
            bunch of
            great
            connections at Hopkins and still keep in touch with multiple members of my team from time to
            time, I
            am
            very
            grateful to
            have had an experience to work with such a prestigious university such as Johns Hopkins as well
            as
            the

        <p>After being inspired by Toby Fox, a solo developer who made the now hit game Undertale almost
            entirely by
            himself, using
            YoYo Studios Gamemaker Studio, which comes with its own UI, built in scripting language with
            Object-Oriented
            functions, pixel art
            editor and much more. I spent the entire summer after my freshman year working nonstop on my
            MacBook
            air and learning the
            fundamentals of
            programming as well as game design, and pixel art by working with Game Maker Studio 2. I
            continued
            working
            on game
            development in my free time throughout the next school year and even learned a bit of audio
            production
            to produce my own
            music for the games since I took piano lessons for quite a few years. (If you are curious
            about
            the
            music, you

            always
            hold
            a special place
            in my heart for introducing me into the tech field and I will always cherish game
            development
            for
            putting me on this
            exciting career path.

    </h2>
    <div class="body-text">
        <p>As my projects grew larger in scale, my MacBook Air wasn’t cutting it for me, with high compile
            times,
            due to its lack
            of a GPU to process the graphics of the games, relatively small 8 gigs of memory, and a laptop
            i5
            processor, building my
            projects was taking much longer than I would like. I decided it was time to build a desktop from
            scratch
            to better
            handle my programming needs. I built a PC with a 9th gen i5 processor, 4GB GTX 1650 GPU, and 32
            gigabytes of RAM. This
            was a neat experience, because this was the first time I had ever built a PC or really worked
            with
            computer hardware
            hands on. Since then I have built multiple computers for others, and I haven’t been scared to
            open computers, swap parts, repair computers,
            laptops,
            game consoles etc.
            I’ve fixed computers, upgraded computers and even broken a couple machines by accident in the
            process,
            it’s all part of
            the learning experience.

        <p>Over winter break I decided I wanted to spend some time working on some personal project ideas I had.
            I
            wanted to make a
            Linux server and use it for a multitude of personal reasons. I decided to buy a used Dell OptiPlex
            desktop
            computer (i5 16
            gigs of ram) since I figured it would be a perfect server and it only cost a couple hundred bucks. I
            installed Ubuntu
            server with Ubuntu desktop overtop of it so I could access GUI applications if I needed to, although
            at
            this
            point, I am
            so comfortable in command line I usually just connect via SSH anyway. I did everything from scratch,
            I
            installed the OS,
            setup the port forwarding and firewall rules on both my router and the UFW firewall on Linux as well
            as
            configuring all
            the programs I needed. For my DNS I used noip2.com a free service which allowed me to get my host
            name
            (jerserver5712.ddns.net), I installed the update client to ensure that the DNS will update IP
            changes
            and
            even setup a
            script I found online which runs on a cron job to automatically renew the hostname for me every 30
            days.
            I
            installed
            openssh server for both sshing into the server and for sftp file transfers, I got a 4tb and 2tb
            drive
            for
            the server to
            use for remote backups. For the remote backups I use a windows tool called sshfs which you can use
            to
            mount
            remote sftp
            servers as network drives, I use this in tandem with a tool called Cobian reflector, which allows
            you to
            backup files to
            either a remote drive, or a remote sftp server (as well as a bunch of other options). I use this
            across
            my
            laptop and
            desktop to back up my files so if anything, ever happens to one of my devices or I need to access
            something
            that’s on my pc I can
            just access
            the sftp server. I can even access it from my phone using an application called Andftp which allows
            me
            to
            access the
            files on the server and also backup my phone’s files as well. I learned a lot about bash, systemd
            services,
            cron jobs
            and had to even do a little bash scripting to get everything configured the way I wanted. I also
            wanted
            this
            server to
            host my website, I installed apache2 web server and got everything setup properly to host my
            personal
            website. I also
            run a Minecraft server to play with friends, which I have configured as a system service to run
            automatically on startup. I additionally configured a mail server which connects to a separate Gmail
            account
            I made just
            for the server, it emails me log files for when automatic updates are performed, whether or not the
            server
            needs to be
            rebooted to finish the updates or if there are errors or not, and it emails me a detailed log file
            from
            Cobian reflector
            for when a backup has completed successfully (or if the backup has errors). I learned a ton about
            networking, port
            forwarding, system/ server administration, a lot of bash and Linux command line and just a lot more
            about
            Linux overall.

        <p>After the server was set up, I figured it was time to make my personal website. I had got my feet wet
            with
            web
            development over the Summer and would look at it here and there after work when I had the time. I
            finished a
            few
            tutorials, and I had a firm understanding of Html, CSS and how they worked together in tandem. I
            even
            made
            a few small
            test pages to experiment around with how it all worked. However, now I decided to put it all
            together
            and
            make a
            Portfolio website, I used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5 and a bit of JavaScript to develop this site.
            I
            went
            out of my
            way to optimize the site to be responsive on PCs as well as on mobile screens by using media
            queries.
            Additionally, I had
            been familiar with GitHub and have always uploaded my projects to my page when I was finished, but I
            had
            never
            integrated it into my workflow. Since this is the industry standard, I decided it was time to learn
            it,
            while making
            this website project, I decided to integrate git version control into my workflow. This made it
            easier
            for
            me to work
            back and forth between my desktop at my apartment, and my laptop when I was on campus. This project
            left
            me
            with some
            great skills in web development, and also a powerful upgrade to my workflow with git version
            control.

        <p>
            After making my website and also experimenting around a bit more, I felt very confident in my
            skills in Html
            and CSS and think it is fair to say that I have a solid grasp on both of them. I decided it was time to
            learn JavaScript
            to complete the trinity of Html, CSS, JavaScript. After I got used to the syntax (this didn't take too
            long since i
            already have a few programming languages under my belt).
            I
            started
            learning and experimenting with the DOM functions of JavaScript, event handlers, click functions and how
            it all works with HTML and CSS. I decided that making a responsive web-app game would be a great way to
            to get a better handle on Javascript. A while ago, i had an idea to make and app for the app store ,
            however, with the power
            of JavaScript i figured it was easier to cut the hastle (and expenses) of getting an app on the app
            store and make a mobile app right in your web browser,
            similar to how the popular game "Wordle" beahves as a browser app. I am using Html ,CSS, Javascript, as
            well as Html's canvas functions to write this game.

    <h2 class="sub-section-title">Moving Forward</h2>
    <div class="body-text">
        <p>In the next upcoming years, I am excited to continue this journey in the tech field and learn
            more about
            development. My goal is to hopefully land a remote role as a Software Developer, Full stack
            Developer, Web Developer,
            Cyber
            Security
            Engineer, or something closely related. Over the past few years, I think the most
            important
            thing I’ve
            learned is that there is always more to learn, and always more ways to improve your skillset. I am
            looking
            forward to
            continuing to grow, network, and develop as I move forward into my career.
