    <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
    <img src="images\me.jpg" class="picture pic-me rounded" alt="Me">
    <p>Hello and welcome to my personal site and online Portfolio! A little bit about me, I have quite the passion for
        everything IT and love learning about all aspects of technology. I got interested in computer
        programming when
        I got an itch for game development after being inspired by what Toby Fox did with Gamemaker Studio to develop
        his hit game
        Undertale. After this, I knew I wanted to learn more about computer programming and IT, and this is what started
        my
        journey into pursuing CS and Software development. Since then, I haven't held back on delving into the different
        fields of IT. This includes, backend programming, database, front-end /web development, server administration /
        sysadmin, cyber security , networking,copmuter hardware, game development, and much more. I hold my Master of
        Science in Cybersecurity and Information
        assurance, as well as a Bachelor of Arts in Communication: Media production with a minor in Computer Science.
        Currently,
        I am working full time as a Software Engineer and UI developer.

            </div>
            <p>In late July, I started my first post-grad developer position working with SAIC for the US patent and
                Trade office.
                I was hired as a full stack developer, to be able to understand both the frontend and backend
                processes at USPTO.
                We work in an Agile / Scrum environment with 2-week sprints and a point system. On the frontend side of
                things, I work
                with JavaScript, html, handlebars, and Jquery to connect the UI to the BE service calls. We develop UI
                interfaces for
                product owners of the patent examination web applications. On the backend side of things, I have used
                Java, spring and
                Junit to write Unit tests for our service classes to increase code coverage. Additionally, I am
                expecting some work with
                SQL as I get assigned more backend responsibility, as well as some Devops work down the road. Since I
                started at SAIC I
                have learned so much from many talented senior devs that have been at the company a long time. I look
                forward to
                continuing my work with SAIC moving forward and seeing what the future holds.

                on

                role
                of a

                faculty both remotely via zoom and in person on site, system administration of their fleet of
                computers. By the end of the Summer, I had learned
                quite a bit about system
                administration,
                troubleshooting, OS issues, as well as working in a bigger more corporate style workplace. I

            <p>During the summer in between my sophomore and junior year of undergrad, I was able to join a
                small startup that manufactures conveyer belt control systems in Havre de Grace Maryland, that gave
                me a
                chance to prove myself in the field. I started out as a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)
                technician
                and
                programmer.
                When I
                first
                joined
                the team my boss and company founder, was the only software developer at the time. He decided to
                shift
                my
                duties to include more Software Development focused work including python, MYSQL, Linux with
                Raspberry PI and some work with Windows Server Powershell. Over the
                course
                of my internship, we did projects for Amazon, Pampered Chef, Eby Brown, and Bd Sparks. This startup
                had grown dramatically
                from
                when
                I had joined until when I left, and I hope to see the copmany continue to grow and expand.
                Additionally, I was later able to receive credit for this as an internship at my
                university. (This Internship Presentation can be viewed <a

            <p>Immediately following graduation from undergrad, I was able to start my graduate program for my M.S. in
                Cybersecurity &
                Information Assurance through WGU’s accelerated online program. I was able to complete the program in
                just about 3
                months, I started July 1st and graduated in late September, which according to my Mentor, is not a
                common
                feat. (He noted
                that most students finish in 1- 2 years, and it is rare to see even 1 or 2 students a term finish the
                entire program
                within one 6-month term, let alone halfway through the term). I learned a lot about InfoSec during grad
                school, and took
                multiple classes involving Penetration Testing, data / file recovery and postmortem forensics.
                Additionally, I
                took classes involving Cybersecurity management, designing of secure networks and secure software
                development, including

            <p>As part of my master’s degree program at WGU I was required to take the certified ethical hacker exam.
                The CEH is a
                widely recognized certification required by many companies to work in Netsec. The exam covers many areas
                of ethical
                hacking including many hacking / penetration testing tools, practices, and compliance policies. It also
                delves into
                network forensics, postmortem analysis and recovery.

                    <p>The Summer after my freshman year of undergrad, I decided to try my hand at game development
                        after
                        being inspired by Toby Fox, a solo developer who made the now hit game Undertale almost
                        entirely by
                        himself, using
                        YoYo Studios Gamemaker Studio, which comes with its own UI, built in scripting language with
                        Object-Oriented
                        functions, pixel art
                        editor and much more. I spent that entire summer after my freshman year working nonstop on my
                        MacBook
                        air and learning the
                        fundamentals of
                        programming as well as game design, and pixel art by working with Game Maker Studio 2. I
                        continued
                        working
                        on game
                        development in my free time throughout the next school year and even learned a bit of audio
                        production
                        to produce my own
                        music for the games since I took piano lessons for quite a few years. (If you are curious
                        about
                        the
                        music, you

                    <h2>Building a Desktop and learning about computer hardware
                    </h2>
                    <p>As my projects grew larger in scale, my MacBook Air wasn’t cutting it for me, with high
                        compile
                        times,
                        due to its lack
                        of a GPU to process the graphics of the games, relatively small 8 gigs of memory, and a
                        laptop
                        i5
                        processor, building my
                        projects was taking much longer than I would like. I decided it was time to build a desktop
                        from
                        scratch
                        to better
                        handle my programming needs. I built a PC with a 9th gen i5 processor, 4GB GTX 1650 GPU, and
                        32
                        gigabytes of RAM. This
                        was a neat experience, because this was the first time I had ever built a PC or really
                        worked
                        with
                        computer hardware
                        hands on. Since then I have built multiple computers for others, and I haven’t been scared
                        to
                        open computers, swap parts, repair computers,
                        laptops,
                        game consoles etc.
                        I’ve fixed computers, upgraded computers and even broken a couple machines by accident in
                        the
                        process,
                        it’s all part of
                        the learning experience.

                    <p>Over the winter break of my senior year, I decided I
                        wanted to make a
                        Linux server and use it for a multitude of personal reasons. I decided to buy a used Dell
                        OptiPlex
                        desktop
                        computer (i5 16
                        gigs of ram) since I figured it would be a perfect server and it only cost a couple hundred
                        bucks. I
                        installed Ubuntu
                        server and configured all the networking and DNS for it to be accessible from the web.
                        I
                        installed
                        openssh server for both sshing into the server and for sftp file transfers and remote
                        file backups.as well. I learned a lot about bash,
                        systemd
                        services,
                        cron jobs
                        and bash scripting to get everything configured the way I wanted. I
                        configured apache web server to host my personal website and a mincraft server to play with
                        friends.
                        Additionally I configured a mail server to email me log files for the file backups and
                        history of automatic. I learned a ton
                        about
                        networking, port
                        forwarding, system/ server administration, a lot of bash and Linux command line and just a
                        lot more
                        about
                        Linux overall. (Note since this , my portfolio site has been migrated to Amazon Web Services
                        hosting, this is to ensure, speed, stability, reliability, and also security, I still use my
                        server for minecraft, file backups, and some other projects)

                    <p>After the server was set up, I figured it was time to make my personal website. I had got my
                        feet wet
                        with
                        web
                        development over the Summer and would look at it here and there after work when I had the
                        time. I
                        finished a
                        few
                        tutorials, and I had a firm understanding of Html, CSS and how they worked together in
                        tandem. I
                        even
                        made
                        a few small
                        test pages to experiment around with how it all worked. However, now I decided to put it all
                        together
                        and
                        make a
                        Portfolio website, I used HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and a bit of Bootsrap to develop this
                        site. ( since then all bootstrap has been removed and replaced with pure javascript)
                        I
                        used flexbox and grid to ensure responsive design across all devices
                        Additionally, I decided to integrate git version control into my workflow, which made
                        it
                        easier
                        for
                        me to work
                        back and forth between my desktop at my apartment, and my laptop when I was on campus. This
                        project
                        left
                        me

                        great skills in web development, and also a powerful upgrade to my workflow with git version

                        Luckily, I got

                        having
                        trouble implementing
                        an online animal adoption form. The goal of the form is so that potential dog adopters could

                        humane
                        society
                        is much easier.
                        Another friend of mine works at a local bagel place, the bagel bakery café which is one of
                        my
                        favorite
                        places around.
                        She oversees their website, which is powered by Pop Menu, a site builder similar to
                        WordPress and
                        Wix.
                        Similar to other site builders, pop menu also has a feature to implement custom html code as
                        well. I
                        was
                        able to clean
                        up the site overall by using embed html and CSS flexbox (to ensure responsive design) to
                        embed their
                        social medias into
                        the site so users could see the updated feed . Additionally, I wrote as bagel timer feature
                        in
                        JavaScript which alerts when the fresh bagels will be ready.

                    <p>During the first semester of my senior year, I participated in Salisbury’s WXSU radio club to
                        host a podcast. This
                        semester, as a personal project,
                        I offered to rebuild their
                        entire website from the ground up as it was old and desperately needed to be updated. The
                        old site which you can view
                        <a href="https://orgs.salisbury.edu/wxsu/">here</a> (for now) was quite rough. The visual
                        design was outdated and many of the links didn't work properly. This site also
                        lacked organization as well as the ability to listen to the radio station live straight from
                        in site. I rebuilt the
                        entire website with a blank slate from the ground up. I used CSS flexbox as well as media
                        queries to ensure responsive
                        design. I built a responsive nav bar with some JavaScript and a dedicated page
                        for forms to apply to host
                        a show. The coolest feature I added was the ability to listen to the show straight from the
                        website's home page. I
                        achieved this by embedding the caster.fm player into the site, I also hyperlinked the
                        station’s phone number right above
                        it, so in just a couple clicks you can call into the show live. Salisbury currently hasn’t
                        put up the site yet (they are
                        planning to soon) as there are some technical formalities that need to be gone through with
                        the university for it to be
                        posted by them. However, you can check it out here on my GitHub pages to see the full site.
