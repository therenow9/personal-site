            <p>Hello and welcome to my personal site and online Portfolio! A little bit about me, I am a college
                senior
                finishing up my last
                semester at
                Salisbury University, I am receiving my Bachelor’s degree in Communications Media Production with a
                minor in Computer
                Science. I quite the passion for everything Computer Science, networking, IT, programming, and
                everything in between!
                The last few years I have been teaching myself all that I can in my free time and loving every
                second of
                it. It all
                started the summer after my freshman year, when I got an itch for game development after being
                inspired
                by Nintendo’s
                Earthbound game series. After this, I knew I wanted to learn more about tech, and this is what
                started
                my journey into
                this wonderful and ever evolving field and I haven’t stopped pursuing tech since. Immediately
                following
                my graduation in
                May 2022, I will be starting my Master’s program in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at
                Western
                Governor’s
                University.

            <p>I’ve come along way and accomplished a lot of things over the past few years to learn what I know now.
                This is how I did
                it through a combination of personal projects, YouTube /web tutorials, school classes, work, internships
                and quite a bit
                of elbow grease! Here is my story from when I started to where I am now!

            <p>After being inspired by Toby Fox, a solo developer who made the now hit game Undertale almost entirely by
                himself, using
                a program called Gamemaker studio 2, which comes with its own UI, built in scripting language with OO
                functions, pixel
                art editor and so much more.. I spent that entire summer working nonstop on my MacBook and learning the
                fundamentals of
                programming as well as game development and sprite making by working with YoYo studios Game Maker Studio
                2. I continued working on game devlopment in my free time throughout the next school year and even
                learned a bit of FL Studio to produce my own music for the games! These projects are available on my
                github if you are interested in seeing some of the projects i made! These first
                few game-dev projects I made will always hold a special place in my heart for introducing me into the
                tech word and I
                will always cherish game development for putting me on this exciting career path.

        </div>
        <div class="py-1 text-center body-text">
            <p>As my projects grew my MacBook air wasn’t cutting it for me, with high compile times, due to its lack of
                a GPU, and
                relatively small 8 gigs of memory, and a laptop i5 processor, building my projects was taking much
                longer than I
                would like. I
                decided it was time to build a desktop from scratch to better handle my programming needs. I built a
                pretty decent
                desktop from scratch, with a GTX 1650 GPU, 32 gigabytes of RAM and a 9th gen i5 processor. This was a
                neat experience
                because this was the first time, I had ever built a pc or really worked with computer hardware hands on.
                Since then, I
                haven’t been scared to open computers, swap parts, repair computers, laptops, game consoles etc. I’ve
                fixed computers,
                upgraded computers and heck even broken a couple machines by accident in the process, it’s all part of
                the learning
                experience!

        <div class="py-1 text-center body-text">
            I continued making games until the end of my sophomore year until I decided I wanted to move away from game
            dev and
            started to shift into to other fields of cs. I decided to take an introductory java class at my university
            to see if I
            would enjoy more traditional programming (I did! I got an A+ in the class) and then continued to teach
            myself a little
            python as well. Additionally, I started getting my feet wet with a little Linux as well!

        <p>With my knowledge I'd gained making games over the past year and videos and tutorials I watched I hoped to
            find a summer
            job doing something tech related. Luckily, I was able to join a small startup and Havre de grace Maryland
            that gave me a
            chance to prove myself in the field. They gave me a job and I started out as a PLC microcontroller
            technician and
            programmer, in which I worked with Rockwell Automation programming and testing software. When I first joined
            the team
            my boss and company founder, Rob
            Ward was the only software developer at the time and he decided to shift my duties to also include python
            and MYSQL
            Scripting to help him out. I learned a lot and coded multiple projects for clients that included python,
            MySQL database,
            as well as some Linux projects involving raspberry psi. Other responsibilities included remote management of
            windows
            servers, continued microcontroller testing as well as some PowerShell configuration. I continued this
            internship through
            the whole summer and even returned and continued interning with them in the winter. I made many great
            connections at pendant and was sad to
            part ways
            with the team, although it was time for me to move on to other opportunities. This, startup had grown
            dramatically from
            when I joined until when I left, I hope that the company continues to grow and flourish and that they
            continue to be
            successful for many years to come! Additionally, I was later able to receive credit for this internship at
            my
            university! Here is a link to their company site, please check them out! <a

            software
            development based, which taught me a lot of essential skills that are industry standard. I took classes
            learning Java,
            C++, computer hardware, algorithms and data structures, as well as calculus and discrete mathematics. I

            shopped around
            and was able to get a great gig at John Hopkins Carey business school in Harbor East, Baltimore city. I took
            on the role
            of a technical support analyst, to help school in assisting our students and staff / faculty, as well as
            help with

            as well as
            assisting those present in office, present in the. By the end of the summer, I had learned quite a bit about
            system
            administration, troubleshooting, OS issues, as well as working in a bigger more corporate style workplace. I
            made a

            forwarding and firewall rules on both my router UFW firewall on Linux. For the DNS I used noip2.com a free
            service which
            allowed me to get my host name, I installed the update client to ensure that the DNS will update IP changes
            and even
            setup a script I found online which runs on a corn job to automatically renews the hostname for me every 30
            days. I
            installed openssh server for both sshing into the server and sftp file transfers, I got a 4tb and 2tb drive
            for the
            server to use for remote backups. For the remote backups I use a windows tool called sshfs which you can use
            to mount
            remote sftp servers as network drives, I used this in tandem with a tool called Cobain reflector which
            allows you to
            backup files to either a remote drive or a remote sftp server. I use this across my laptop and desktop to
            back up my
            files so if anything ever happens or I need to access something that’s on my pc I can just access the sftp
            server. I can
            even access it from my phone using an application called “Andftp” which allows me to access the files of the
            server and
            also backup my phones files as well! I also learned a lot about bash, systemd services, cron and had to even
            do a little
            bash scripting to get everything configured the way I want. I also wanted this server to host my website, I
            installed
            apache2 web server and got everything setup properly to host my personal website (which you are on now!). I
            also run a
            Minecraft server to play with friends (java and or bedrock) on the server which I have configured as a
            system service to
            run automatically on startup. I additionally configured a mail server which connects to a separate Gmail
            account I made
            just for the server, it emails me log files for when automatic updates are performed, whether or not the
            server needs to
            be rebooted to finish the updates, and it emails me a detailed log file from Cobian reflector for when a
            backup has
            completed successfully (or if the backup has errors). I learned a TON about networking, port forwarding,
            system/ server
            administration, and ALOT of bash and Linux command line and just a lot more about Linux overall and Linux
            overall.

        <p>After I had all that configured (apache was the biggest pain), I figured it was time to make my personal
            website. I had got my feet wet
            with web
            development over the Summer and would look at it here and there after work sometimes. I finished a few
            tutorials, and I
            had a firm understanding of Html5, CSS and how they worked together in tandem. I even mad e a few small test
            pages but
            nothing serious. However, now I decided to put it altogether and make a Portfolio website, I used HTML5,
            CSS3, Bootstrap
            and a tiny bit of JavaScript to develop this site. Additionally, I had been familiar with GitHub and had
            always backed
            up my projects there when finished but had never integrated it into my workflow. Since this is the industry
            standard, I
            decided it was time to learn it, while making website project I decided to integrate git version control
            into my
            workflow, this made it easier for me to work back and forth between my desktop at my apartment, and my
            laptop when I was
            on campus. Finally, this project left me with some great skills in web development, and also a powerful
            upgrade to my
            workflow which is part of the industry standard and will also allow me to work more seamlessly between all
            my devices. Additionally, I am currently in my final semester at Salisbury university, I am taking 2 classes
            (COMM 343
            communicating on
            the web,
            and COMM 490 communicating with code) which BOTH focus on HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript! Hopefully this will
            cement my skills in webdev even further. When I am finished
            with these
            classes I will be posting all of the work on my GitHub as usual and after that it’s time for
            graduation.
