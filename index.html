            <p>Hello and welcome to my personal site and online Portfolio! A little bit about me, I am a college
                senior
                finishing up my last
                semester at
                Salisbury University, I am receiving my Bachelor’s degree in Communications Media Production with a
                minor in Computer
                Science. I quite the passion for everything Computer Science, networking, IT, programming, and
                everything in between!
                The last few years I have been teaching myself all that I can in my free time and loving every
                second of
                it. It all
                started the summer after my freshman year, when I got an itch for game development after being
                inspired
                by Nintendo’s
                Earthbound game series. After this, I knew I wanted to learn more about tech, and this is what
                started
                my journey into
                this wonderful and ever evolving field and I haven’t stopped pursuing tech since. Immediately
                following
                my graduation in
                May 2022, I will be starting my Master’s program in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at
                Western
                Governor’s
                University.

            <p>I’ve come along way and accomplished a lot of things over the past few years to learn what I know now.
                This is how I did
                it through a combination of personal projects, YouTube /web tutorials, school classes, work, internships
                and quite a bit
                of elbow grease! Here is my story from when I started to where I am now!

            <p>After being inspired by Toby Fox, a solo developer who made the now hit game Undertale almost entirely by
                himself, using
                a program called Gamemaker studio 2, which comes with its own UI, built in scripting language with OO
                functions, pixel
                art editor and so much more.. I spent that entire summer working nonstop on my MacBook and learning the
                fundamentals of
                programming as well as game development and sprite making by working with YoYo studios Game Maker Studio
                2. I continued working on game devlopment in my free time throughout the next school year and even
                learned a bit of FL Studio to produce my own music for the games! These projects are available on my
                github if you are interested in seeing some of the projects i made! These first
                few game-dev projects I made will always hold a special place in my heart for introducing me into the
                tech word and I
                will always cherish game development for putting me on this exciting career path.

            <p>As my projects grew my MacBook air wasn’t cutting it for me, with high compile times, due to its lack of
                a GPU, and
                relatively small 8 gigs of memory, and a laptop i5 processor, building my projects was taking much
                longer than I
                would like. I
                decided it was time to build a desktop from scratch to better handle my programming needs. I built a
                pretty decent
                desktop from scratch, with a GTX 1650 GPU, 32 gigabytes of RAM and a 9th gen i5 processor. This was a
                neat experience
                because this was the first time, I had ever built a pc or really worked with computer hardware hands on.
                Since then, I
                haven’t been scared to open computers, swap parts, repair computers, laptops, game consoles etc. I’ve
                fixed computers,
                upgraded computers and heck even broken a couple machines by accident in the process, it’s all part of
                the learning
                experience!
