        <p>Hello and welcome to my personal site and online Portfolio! A little bit about me, I am a college
            senior
            finishing up my last
            semester at
            Salisbury University, I am receiving my Bachelor’s degree in Communications Media Production with a
            minor in Computer
            Science. I have quite the passion for everything Computer Science, networking, IT, programming, and
            everything in between!
            The last few years I have been teaching myself all that I can in my free time and in University Classes.
            I got interested in computer programming after I got an itch for game development after being
            inspired
            by Nintendo’s
            Earthbound game series. After this, I knew I wanted to learn more about copmuter programming and tech, and
            this is what
            started
            my journey into
            pursuing CS and Software development. Immediately
            following
            my graduation in
            May 2022, I will be starting my Master’s program in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at
            Western
            Governor’s
            University. My goal is to land a position as a fullstack Software Developer, after finishing graduate
            school.

                <p>Over the past few years, I have accomplished quite a lot , and learned many different technologies.
                    This is how I did it, through a combination of self-teaching, personal projects, YouTube / online
                    tutorials, university
                    classes,
                    internships and quite a bit of elbow grease.

                <p>I am graduating from Salisbury University with a Major in Communications Media Production. In
                    this track, I took
                    multiple classes focusing on web development with Html, Css, and JavaScript. Additionally, I
                    took a
                    minor in Computer Science,
                    the Computer Science track at SU is very software development based, which taught me a
                    lot of essential skills
                    that are standard in the industry. I took classes learning Java, C++, advanced C++ with
                    algorithms and
                    data
                    structures, computer
                    hardware, as well classes in calculus and discrete mathematics. I finished my minor in CS my
                    junior
                    year and all of my code,
                    projects, and homework’s that I have completed are available to view on my GitHub as well as my
                    code from the Web

                    I think it will compliment a lot of the skills I already have very well (Linux, OS, servers,

                    system
                    administration, programming, database, web development) as well as make me more marketable on the

                    market. I am very
                    excited to start the program which I am starting in June following my graduation, in May 2022.

                <p>During the summer in between my sophmore and junior year I was able to join a
                    small startup that manufactures conveyer belt control systems in Havre de Grace Maryland, that gave
                    me a
                    chance to prove myself in the field. I started out as a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)
                    technician
                    and
                    programmer, in which I worked with Rockwell Automation programming and testing software as well as
                    Virtualization Software with Virtualbox. When I
                    first
                    joined
                    the team my boss and company founder, was the only software developer at the time. He decided to
                    shift
                    my
                    duties to also include python and MYSQL scripting to support the ever-increasing amount of clients
                    we
                    had
                    with WCS (Warehouse Control System) related projects. I learned a lot and coded multiple projects
                    for
                    clients that included python, MySQL database, as well as some Linux projects involving configuration
                    of
                    raspberry Pis for automation. Other responsibilities included remote management of windows servers,
                    continued microcontroller testing as well as some PowerShell configuration. I continued this
                    internship
                    through the whole summer and even returned and continued interning with them in the winter. Over the
                    course
                    of my internship, we did projects for Amazon, Pampered Chef, Eby Brown, and Bd Sparks. This startup
                    had grown dramatically
                    from
                    when
                    I had joined until when I left, and I hope to see the copmany continue to grow and expand.
                    Additionally, I was later able to receive credit for this as an internship at my
                    university. (This Internship Presentation can be viewed <a

                    land a
                    great opportunity at John Hopkins Carey business school in Harbor East, Baltimore city. I took
                    on
                    the

                    well as help
                    with system administration of their fleet of computers. My duties included management of Active

                    Microsoft
                    Endpoint Configuration Management console, setting up classrooms and conference rooms with

                    assisting
                    those present on campus. By the end of the Summer, I had learned quite a bit about system
                    administration,
                    troubleshooting, OS issues, as well as working in a bigger more corporate style workplace. I

                            continued
                            working
                            on game
                            development in my free time throughout the next school year and even learned a bit of audio
                            production
                            to produce my own
                            music for the games since I took piano lessons for quite a few years. (If you are curious

                        <p>As my projects grew larger in scale, my MacBook Air wasn’t cutting it for me, with high
                            compile
                            times,
                            due to its lack
                            of a GPU to process the graphics of the games, relatively small 8 gigs of memory, and a
                            laptop
                            i5
                            processor, building my
                            projects was taking much longer than I would like. I decided it was time to build a desktop
                            from
                            scratch
                            to better
                            handle my programming needs. I built a PC with a 9th gen i5 processor, 4GB GTX 1650 GPU, and
                            32
                            gigabytes of RAM. This
                            was a neat experience, because this was the first time I had ever built a PC or really
                            worked
                            with
                            computer hardware
                            hands on. Since then I have built multiple computers for others, and I haven’t been scared
                            to
                            open computers, swap parts, repair computers,
                            laptops,
                            game consoles etc.
                            I’ve fixed computers, upgraded computers and even broken a couple machines by accident in
                            the
                            process,
                            it’s all part of
                            the learning experience.

                        <p>Over winter break of my senior year, I decided I
                            wanted to make a
                            Linux server and use it for a multitude of personal reasons. I decided to buy a used Dell
                            OptiPlex
                            desktop
                            computer (i5 16
                            gigs of ram) since I figured it would be a perfect server and it only cost a couple hundred
                            bucks. I
                            installed Ubuntu
                            server with Ubuntu desktop overtop of it so I could access GUI applications if I needed to,
                            although
                            I
                            usually SSH into terminal becasue it's way easier anyway. I did everything from scratch,
                            I
                            installed the OS,
                            setup the port forwarding and firewall rules on both my router and the UFW firewall on Linux
                            as well
                            as
                            configuring all
                            the programs I needed. For my DNS I used noip2.com a free service which allowed me to get my
                            host
                            name
                            (jerserver5712.ddns.net), I installed the update client to ensure that the DNS will update
                            IP
                            changes
                            and
                            even setup a
                            script I found online which runs on a cron job to automatically renew the hostname for me
                            every 30
                            days.
                            I
                            installed
                            openssh server for both sshing into the server and for sftp file transfers, I got a 4tb and
                            2tb
                            drive
                            for
                            the server to
                            use for remote backups. For the remote backups I use a windows tool called sshfs which you
                            can use
                            to
                            mount
                            remote sftp
                            servers as network drives, I use this in tandem with a tool called Cobian reflector, which
                            allows
                            you to
                            backup files to
                            either a remote drive, or a remote sftp server (as well as a bunch of other options). I use
                            this
                            across
                            my
                            laptop and
                            desktop to back up my files so if anything, ever happens to one of my devices or I need to
                            access
                            something
                            that’s on my pc I can
                            just access
                            the sftp server. I can even access it from my phone using an application called Andftp which
                            allows
                            me
                            to
                            access the
                            files on the server and also backup my phone’s files as well. I learned a lot about bash,
                            systemd
                            services,
                            cron jobs
                            and had to even do a little bash scripting to get everything configured the way I wanted. I
                            also
                            wanted
                            this
                            server to
                            host my website, I installed apache2 web server and got everything setup properly to host my
                            personal
                            website. I also
                            run a Minecraft server to play with friends, which I have configured as a system service to
                            run
                            automatically on startup. I additionally configured a mail server which connects to a
                            separate Gmail
                            account
                            I made just
                            for the server, it emails me log files for when automatic updates are performed, whether or
                            not the
                            server
                            needs to be
                            rebooted to finish the updates or if there are errors or not, and it emails me a detailed
                            log file
                            from
                            Cobian reflector
                            for when a backup has completed successfully (or if the backup has errors). I learned a ton
                            about
                            networking, port
                            forwarding, system/ server administration, a lot of bash and Linux command line and just a
                            lot more
                            about
                            Linux overall.

                        <p>After the server was set up, I figured it was time to make my personal website. I had got my
                            feet wet
                            with
                            web
                            development over the Summer and would look at it here and there after work when I had the
                            time. I
                            finished a
                            few
                            tutorials, and I had a firm understanding of Html, CSS and how they worked together in
                            tandem. I
                            even
                            made
                            a few small
                            test pages to experiment around with how it all worked. However, now I decided to put it all
                            together
                            and
                            make a
                            Portfolio website, I used HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and a bit of Bootsrap to develop this
                            site.
                            I
                            went
                            out of my
                            way to optimize the site to be responsive on PCs as well as on mobile screens by using media
                            queries along with CSS Flexbox and Grid.
                            Additionally, I had
                            been familiar with GitHub and have always uploaded my projects to my page when I was
                            finished, but I
                            had
                            never
                            integrated it into my workflow. Since this is the industry standard, I decided it was time
                            to learn
                            it,
                            while making
                            this website project, I decided to integrate git version control into my workflow. This made
                            it
                            easier

                            me
                            with some
                            great skills in web development, and also a powerful upgrade to my workflow with git version

                        <p>As i continued to work with web development more and more, I was eager to apply my skills in
                            a
                            practical
                            setting.
                            Luckily, I got
                            a few chances to do this, first I got a call from a good buddy of mine who works with the
                            Wicomico
                            Humane society and
                            was asking me some help with their website. The website is made with WordPress, and he was
                            having
                            trouble implementing
                            an online animal adoption form. The goal of the form is so that potential dog adopters could
                            input
                            the
                            info in the form
                            and the results be emailed to the shelter, as opposed to the way they had been doing it…
                            getting the
                            forms faxed over. I
                            was able to get the embedded html form code sorted out with him and now adopting from the
                            humane
                            society
                            is much easier.
                            Another friend of mine works at a local bagel place, the bagel bakery café which is one of
                            my
                            favorite
                            places around.
                            She oversees their website, which is powered by Pop Menu, a site builder similar to
                            WordPress and
                            Wix.
                            The goal was to
                            implement a timer that would tell when the fresh bagels are ready as well as to clean up the
                            site
                            design
                            overall.
                            Similar to other site builders, pop menu also has a feature to implement custom html code as
                            well. I
                            was
                            able to clean
                            up the site overall by using embed html and CSS flexbox (to ensure responsive design) to
                            embed their
                            social medias into
                            the site so users could see the updated feed . Additionally, I wrote the bagel timer feature
                            in
                            JavaScript. This was some great practice as i have been working with Javascript in both of
                            my web
                            devlopment classes and also working with it in some personal projects to become more
                            proficient in
                            it.I was able
                            to implement that into the site as well as cleaning up some other visual aspects of the site
                            as
                            well.

                    <div class="body-text">
                        <p>During the first semester of my senior year, I participated in Salisbury’s WXSU radio club to
                            host a podcast. This
                            semester as a personal project, and because I am friends with a few of the student managers,
                            I offered to rebuild their
                            entire website from the ground up as it was old and desperately needed to be updated. The
                            old site which you can view
                            <a href="https://orgs.salisbury.edu/wxsu/">here</a> (for now) was quite rough. The colors
                            didn’t mesh, it looked very dated
                            and some links
                            to main pages didn’t even
                            work. Additionally, the site was completely broken on mobile to the point where it was
                            almost unusable. This site also
                            lacked organization as well as the ability to listen to the radio station live straight from
                            in site. I rebuilt the
                            entire website from a blank slate from the ground up. I used CSS flexbox as well as media
                            queries to ensure responsive
                            design, as I feel this is one of the most important things to have, especially for a site
                            used by college students who
                            are always on mobile. I built a responsive nav bar with some JavaScript and a dedicated page
                            for forms to apply to host
                            a show. The coolest feature I added was the ability to listen to the show straight from the
                            websites home page. I
                            achieved this by embedding the caster.fm player into the site, I also hyperlinked the
                            station’s phone number right above
                            it, so in just a couple clicks you can call into the show live. Salisbury currently hasn’t
                            put up the site yet (they are
                            planning to soon) as there are some technical formalities that need to be gone through with
                            the university for it to be
                            posted by them. However, you can check it out here on my GitHub pages to see the full site.

                        <p>In the next upcoming years, I am excited to continue this journey in the tech field and learn
                            more about
                            development. My goal is to hopefully land a remote role as a Software Developer, Full stack

                            important
                            thing I’ve
                            learned is that there is always more to learn, and always more ways to improve your
                            skillset. I am
