        <p>Hello and welcome to my personal site and online Portfolio! A little bit about me, I am a college
            senior
            finishing up my last
            semester at
            Salisbury University, I am receiving my Bachelor’s degree in Communications Media Production with a
            minor in Computer
            Science. I have quite the passion for everything Computer Science, networking, IT, programming, and
            everything in between!
            The last few years I have been teaching myself all that I can in my free time and in University Classes.
            I got interested in computer programming after I got an itch for game development after being
            inspired
            by Nintendo’s
            Earthbound game series. After this, I knew I wanted to learn more about copmuter programming and tech, and
            this is what
            started
            my journey into
            pursuing CS and Software development. Immediately
            following
            my graduation in
            May 2022, I will be starting my Master’s program in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at
            Western
            Governor’s
            University. My goal is to land a position as a fullstack Software Developer, after finishing graduate
            school.

        <p>I am graduating from Salisbury University with a Major in Communications Media Production. In
            this track, I took
            multiple classes focusing on web development with Html, Css, and JavaScript. Additionally, I
            took a
            minor in Computer Science,
            the Computer Science track at SU is very software development based, which taught me a
            lot of essential skills
            that are standard in the industry. All Development classes I took at Salisbury are available to view

        <p>During the summer in between my sophmore and junior year I was able to join a
            small startup that manufactures conveyer belt control systems in Havre de Grace Maryland, that gave
            me a
            chance to prove myself in the field. I started out as a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)
            technician
            and
            programmer.
            When I
            first
            joined
            the team my boss and company founder, was the only software developer at the time. He decided to
            shift
            my
            duties to include more Software Development focused work including python, MYSQL, Linux with
            Raspberry PI and some work with Windows Server Powershell. Over the
            course
            of my internship, we did projects for Amazon, Pampered Chef, Eby Brown, and Bd Sparks. This startup
            had grown dramatically
            from
            when
            I had joined until when I left, and I hope to see the copmany continue to grow and expand.
            Additionally, I was later able to receive credit for this as an internship at my
            university. (This Internship Presentation can be viewed <a

        <p>During the summer in between my Junior and Senior Year, I was able to
            land a
            great opportunity at John Hopkins Carey business school in Harbor East, Baltimore city. I took
            on
            the
            role
            of a
            technical support analyst, in which I was responsible for assisting our students and staff /
            faculty both remotely via zoom and in person on site, system administration of their fleet of
            computers. By the end of the Summer, I had learned
            quite a bit about system
            administration,
            troubleshooting, OS issues, as well as working in a bigger more corporate style workplace. I
            made a

        <p>After being inspired by Toby Fox, a solo developer who made the now hit game Undertale almost
            entirely by
            himself, using
            YoYo Studios Gamemaker Studio, which comes with its own UI, built in scripting language with
            Object-Oriented
            functions, pixel art
            editor and much more. I spent the entire summer after my freshman year working nonstop on my
            MacBook
            air and learning the
            fundamentals of
            programming as well as game design, and pixel art by working with Game Maker Studio 2. I
            continued
            working
            on game
            development in my free time throughout the next school year and even learned a bit of audio
            production
            to produce my own
            music for the games since I took piano lessons for quite a few years. (If you are curious
            about
            the
            music, you

            always
            hold
            a special place
            in my heart for introducing me into the tech field and I will always cherish game
            development
            for

    </h2>
    <div class="body-text">
        <p>As my projects grew larger in scale, my MacBook Air wasn’t cutting it for me, with high
            compile
            times,
            due to its lack
            of a GPU to process the graphics of the games, relatively small 8 gigs of memory, and a
            laptop
            i5
            processor, building my
            projects was taking much longer than I would like. I decided it was time to build a desktop
            from
            scratch
            to better
            handle my programming needs. I built a PC with a 9th gen i5 processor, 4GB GTX 1650 GPU, and
            32
            gigabytes of RAM. This
            was a neat experience, because this was the first time I had ever built a PC or really
            worked
            with
            computer hardware
            hands on. Since then I have built multiple computers for others, and I haven’t been scared
            to
            open computers, swap parts, repair computers,
            laptops,
            game consoles etc.
            I’ve fixed computers, upgraded computers and even broken a couple machines by accident in
            the
            process,
            it’s all part of
            the learning experience.

        <p>Over winter break of my senior year, I decided I
            wanted to make a
            Linux server and use it for a multitude of personal reasons. I decided to buy a used Dell
            OptiPlex
            desktop
            computer (i5 16
            gigs of ram) since I figured it would be a perfect server and it only cost a couple hundred
            bucks. I
            installed Ubuntu
            server and configured all the networking and DNS for it to be accessible from the web.
            I
            installed
            openssh server for both sshing into the server and for sftp file transfers and remote
            file backups.as well. I learned a lot about bash,
            systemd
            services,
            cron jobs
            and bash scripting to get everything configured the way I wanted. I
            configured apache web server to host my personal website and a mincraft server to play with
            friends.
            Additionally I configured a mail server to email me log files for the file backups and
            history of automatic. I learned a ton
            about
            networking, port
            forwarding, system/ server administration, a lot of bash and Linux command line and just a
            lot more
            about
            Linux overall. (Note since this , my portfolio site has been migrated to Amazon Web Services
            hosting, this is to ensure, speed, stability, reliability, and also security, I still use my
            server for minecraft, file backups, and some other projects)

        <p>After the server was set up, I figured it was time to make my personal website. I had got my
            feet wet
            with
            web
            development over the Summer and would look at it here and there after work when I had the
            time. I
            finished a
            few
            tutorials, and I had a firm understanding of Html, CSS and how they worked together in
            tandem. I
            even
            made
            a few small
            test pages to experiment around with how it all worked. However, now I decided to put it all
            together
            and
            make a
            Portfolio website, I used HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and a bit of Bootsrap to develop this
            site. ( since then all bootstrap has been removed and replaced with pure javascript)
            I
            used flexbox and grid to ensure responsive design across all devices
            Additionally, I decided to integrate git version control into my workflow, which made
            it
            easier
            for
            me to work
            back and forth between my desktop at my apartment, and my laptop when I was on campus. This
            project
            left
            me
            with some
            great skills in web development, and also a powerful upgrade to my workflow with git version
            control.

        <p>As i continued to work with web development more and more, I was eager to apply my skills in
            a
            practical
            setting.
            Luckily, I got
            a few chances to do this, first I got a call from a good buddy of mine who works with the
            Wicomico
            Humane society and
            was asking me some help with their website. The website is made with WordPress, and he was
            having
            trouble implementing
            an online animal adoption form. The goal of the form is so that potential dog adopters could
            input
            the
            info in the form
            and the results be emailed to the shelter, as opposed to the way they had been doing it…
            getting the
            forms faxed over. I
            was able to get the embedded html form code sorted out with him and now adopting from the
            humane
            society
            is much easier.
            Another friend of mine works at a local bagel place, the bagel bakery café which is one of
            my
            favorite
            places around.
            She oversees their website, which is powered by Pop Menu, a site builder similar to
            WordPress and
            Wix.
            Similar to other site builders, pop menu also has a feature to implement custom html code as
            well. I
            was
            able to clean
            up the site overall by using embed html and CSS flexbox (to ensure responsive design) to
            embed their
            social medias into
            the site so users could see the updated feed . Additionally, I wrote as bagel timer feature
            in
            JavaScript which alerts when the fresh bagels will be ready.

        <p>During the first semester of my senior year, I participated in Salisbury’s WXSU radio club to
            host a podcast. This
            semester, as a personal project,
            I offered to rebuild their
            entire website from the ground up as it was old and desperately needed to be updated. The
            old site which you can view
            <a href="https://orgs.salisbury.edu/wxsu/">here</a> (for now) was quite rough. The visual
            design was outdated and many of the links didn't work properly. This site also
            lacked organization as well as the ability to listen to the radio station live straight from
            in site. I rebuilt the
            entire website from a blank slate from the ground up. I used CSS flexbox as well as media
            queries to ensure responsive
            design. I built a responsive nav bar with some JavaScript and a dedicated page
            for forms to apply to host
            a show. The coolest feature I added was the ability to listen to the show straight from the
            websites home page. I
            achieved this by embedding the caster.fm player into the site, I also hyperlinked the
            station’s phone number right above
            it, so in just a couple clicks you can call into the show live. Salisbury currently hasn’t
            put up the site yet (they are
            planning to soon) as there are some technical formalities that need to be gone through with
            the university for it to be
            posted by them. However, you can check it out here on my GitHub pages to see the full site.

        <p>In the next upcoming years, I am excited to continue this journey in the tech field and learn
            more about
            development. My goal is to hopefully land a remote role as a Software Developer, Full stack
            Developer, Web Developer,
            Cyber
            Security
            Engineer, or something closely related. Over the past few years, I think the most
            important
            thing I’ve
            learned is that there is always more to learn, and always more ways to improve your
            skillset. I am
            looking
            forward to
            continuing to grow, network, and develop as I move forward into my career.
