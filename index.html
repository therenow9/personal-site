            <p>Hello and welcome to my personal site and online Portfolio! A little bit about me, I am a college
                senior
                finishing up my last
                semester at
                Salisbury University, I am receiving my Bachelor’s degree in Communications Media Production with a
                minor in Computer
                Science. I have quite the passion for everything Computer Science, networking, IT, programming, and
                everything in between!
                The last few years I have been teaching myself all that I can in my free time and in University Classes.
                It all
                started the summer after my freshman year, when I got an itch for game development after being
                inspired
                by Nintendo’s
                Earthbound game series. After this, I knew I wanted to learn more about tech, and this is what
                started
                my journey into
                this wonderful and ever evolving field and I haven’t stopped pursuing tech since. Immediately
                following
                my graduation in
                May 2022, I will be starting my Master’s program in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at
                Western
                Governor’s
                University.

            <p>I’ve come a long way over the past few years, and I have accomplished quite a lot.
                This is how I did it, through a combination of self-teaching, personal projects, YouTube / online
                tutorials, university
                classes,
                internships and quite a bit of elbow grease. Here is my story from when I started to where I am now.

            <p>After being inspired by Toby Fox, a solo developer who made the now hit game Undertale almost entirely by
                himself, using
                YoYo Studios Gamemaker Studio, which comes with its own UI, built in scripting language with
                Object-Oriented
                functions, pixel art
                editor and much more. I spent that entire summer working nonstop on my MacBook air and learning the
                fundamentals of
                programming as well as game design, and pixel art by working with Game Maker Studio 2. I continued
                working
                on game
                development in my free time throughout the next school year and even learned a bit of audio production
                to produce my own
                music for the games since I used to take piano lessons for quite a few years. These projects are
                available to
                view on
                my
                GitHub
                if you are
                interested in seeing some of the game mockups I made. These first few game-dev projects will always hold
                a special place
                in my heart for introducing me into the tech field and I will always cherish game development for
                putting me on this
                exciting career path.

        <div class="py-1 text-center body-text">
            <p>As my projects grew larger in scale, my MacBook Air wasn’t cutting it for me, with high compile times,
                due to its lack
                of a GPU to process the graphics of the games, relatively small 8 gigs of memory, and a laptop i5
                processor, building my
                projects was taking much longer than I would like. I decided it was time to build a desktop from scratch
                to better
                handle my programming needs. I built a PC with a 9th gen i5 processor, 4GB GTX 1650 GPU, and 32
                gigabytes of RAM. This
                was a neat experience, because this was the first time I had ever built a PC or really worked with
                computer hardware
                hands on. Since then, I haven’t been scared to open computers, swap parts, repair computers, laptops,
                game consoles etc.
                I’ve fixed computers, upgraded computers and even broken a couple machines by accident in the process,
                it’s all part of
                the learning experience.

            I continued making games until the end of my sophomore year when I decided I wanted to explore other fields
            of Computer
            Science. I decided to take an introductory java class at my university to see if I would enjoy more
            traditional
            programming that was not game dev related (I did. I got an A+ in the class!) After the class was over, I
            continued to
            teach myself a little python as well as get my feet wet with a little bit of Linux
            by installing mint
            on an old laptop I had and experimenting around with that.

        <p>With my knowledge I had gained making games over the past year and through online videos and tutorials I
            watched, I was hopeful to find a summer job doing something tech related. Luckily, I was able to join a
            small startup that manufactures conveyer belt control systems in Havre de Grace Maryland, that gave me a
            chance to prove myself in the field. I started out as a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) technician and
            programmer, in which I worked with Rockwell Automation programming and testing software. When I first joined
            the team my boss and company founder, was the only software developer at the time. He decided to shift my
            duties to also include python and MYSQL scripting to support the ever-increasing amount of clients we had
            with WCS (Warehouse Control System) related projects. I learned a lot and coded multiple projects for
            clients that included python, MySQL database, as well as some Linux projects involving configuration of
            raspberry Pis for automation. Other responsibilities included remote management of windows servers,
            continued microcontroller testing as well as some PowerShell configuration. I continued this internship
            through the whole summer and even returned and continued interning with them in the winter. Over the course
            of my internship, we did projects for Amazon, Pampered Chef, Eby Brown, and Bd Sparks. I made many great
            connections at pendant and was sad to part ways with the team. This startup had grown dramatically from when
            I had joined until when I left, and I hope that the company continues to grow and be successful for many
            years to come! Additionally, I was later able to receive credit for this as an internship at my university.
            Here is a link to their company site, if you have any industrial control system needs, these are the guys to
            do it.

            minor to my studies to learn more about the field of Software Development. At my university, the Computer
            Science track
            is very software development based, which taught me a lot of essential skills that are standard in the
            industry. I took

            discrete

            of a
            technical support analyst, in which I was responsible for assisting our students and staff / faculty, as
            well as help

            assisting
            those present on campus. By the end of the Summer, I had learned quite a bit about system administration,
            troubleshooting, OS issues, as well as working in a bigger more corporate style workplace. I made a bunch of

            computer (i5 16
            gigs of ram) since I figured it would be a perfect server and it only cost a couple hundred bucks. I
            installed Ubuntu
            server with Ubuntu desktop overtop of it so I could access GUI applications if I needed to, although at this
            point, I am
            so comfortable in command line I usually just connect via SSH anyway. I did everything from scratch, I
            installed the OS,
            setup the port forwarding and firewall rules on both my router and the UFW firewall on Linux as well as
            configuring all
            the programs I needed. For my DNS I used noip2.com a free service which allowed me to get my host
            name
            (jerserver5712.ddns.net), I installed the update client to ensure that the DNS will update IP changes and
            even setup a
            script I found online which runs on a cron job to automatically renew the hostname for me every 30 days. I
            installed
            openssh server for both sshing into the server and for sftp file transfers, I got a 4tb and 2tb drive for
            the server to
            use for remote backups. For the remote backups I use a windows tool called sshfs which you can use to mount
            remote sftp
            servers as network drives, I use this in tandem with a tool called Cobian reflector, which allows you to
            backup files to
            either a remote drive, or a remote sftp server (as well as a bunch of other options). I use this across my
            laptop and
            desktop to back up my files so if anything, ever happens to one of my devices or I need to access something
            that’s on my pc I can
            just access
            the sftp server. I can even access it from my phone using an application called Andftp which allows me to
            access the
            files on the server and also backup my phone’s files as well. I learned a lot about bash, systemd services,
            cron jobs
            and had to even do a little bash scripting to get everything configured the way I wanted. I also wanted this
            server to
            host my website, I installed apache2 web server and got everything setup properly to host my personal
            website. I also
            run a Minecraft server to play with friends, which I have configured as a system service to run
            automatically on startup. I additionally configured a mail server which connects to a separate Gmail account
            I made just
            for the server, it emails me log files for when automatic updates are performed, whether or not the server
            needs to be
            rebooted to finish the updates or if there are errors or not, and it emails me a detailed log file from
            Cobian reflector
            for when a backup has completed successfully (or if the backup has errors). I learned a ton about
            networking, port
            forwarding, system/ server administration, a lot of bash and Linux command line and just a lot more about
            Linux overall.

        <p>After the server was set up, I figured it was time to make my personal website. I had got my feet wet with
            web
            development over the Summer and would look at it here and there after work when I had the time. I finished a
            few
            tutorials, and I had a firm understanding of Html, CSS and how they worked together in tandem. I even made
            a few small
            test pages to experiment around with how it all worked. However, now I decided to put it all together and
            make a
            Portfolio website, I used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5 and a tiny bit of JavaScript to develop this site. I went
            out of my
            way to optimize the site to be responsive on PCs as well as on mobile screens by using media queries.
            Additionally, I had
            been familiar with GitHub and have always uploaded my projects to my page when I was finished, but I had
            never
            integrated it into my workflow. Since this is the industry standard, I decided it was time to learn it,
            while making
            this website project, I decided to integrate git version control into my workflow. This made it easier for
            me to work
            back and forth between my desktop at my apartment, and my laptop when I was on campus. This project left me
            with some
            great skills in web development, and also a powerful upgrade to my workflow with git version control. I am
            currently in
            my final semester at Salisbury university, and two of the classes i am enrolled in (COMM 343 communicating
            on the web, and
            COMM 490
            communicating with code) focus on web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hopefully
            these courses
            will improve my skills in web development even further. When I am finished with these classes, I will be
            posting all of
            the course work on my Github.

        <p>Immediately following graduation, I will be pursuing my master’s degree in science focusing in Cybersecurity
            and
            Information Assurance at Western Governor’s University. The program will focus on secure network design,
            system
            administration, IT management, ethical hacking, and secure software development. I decided to pursue this
            degree because
            I think it will compliment a lot of the skills I already have very well (Linux, OS, servers, networking,
            system
            administration, programming, database, web development) as well as make me more marketable on the job
            market. I am very
            excited to start the program which I am starting in June following my graduation, in May 2022.

        <p>In the next upcoming years, I am excited to continue this journey in the tech field and learn
            more about
            development. My goal is to hopefully land a remote role as a Software Engineer, Full stack Engineer, Cyber
            Security
            Engineer, Web Developer, or something closely related. Over the past few years, I think the most important
            thing I’ve
            learned is that there is always more to learn, and always more ways to improve your skillset. I am looking
            forward to
            continuing to grow, network, and develop as I move forward into my career.
